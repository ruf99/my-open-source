Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform that aims to improve access to quality education worldwide for everyone.
It allows users to create and share interactive educational content and uses a conversational approach to learning. This approach provides learners immediate feedback, making the learning experience more engaging and effective. I worked on this project in a group, and while we were picking out projects to finalize, we were instantly drawn towards Oppia because it is a humanitarian project that is meaningful to all of us, and is community friendly, active and organized.
