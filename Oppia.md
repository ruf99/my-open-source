Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform that aims to improve access to quality education worldwide for everyone.
It allows users to create and share interactive educational content and uses a conversational approach to learning. This approach provides learners immediate feedback, making the learning experience more engaging and effective. I worked on this project in a group\*, and while we were picking out projects to finalize, we were instantly drawn towards Oppia because it is a humanitarian project that is meaningful to all of us, and is community friendly, active and organized.

These were my group members:

- [Leah Durrett](https://github.com/howtofly-lab)
- [Seoeun Hong](https://github.com/seoeunHong)
- [Nicole Sosa](https://github.com/nicoleSosa)

We established communication with the maintainers via GitHub issues & discussion posts, and focused our contributions on three different groups: Bug Reports, Feature Requests & Code Contributions.
We had several successful contributions to the project, and were able to make 15 various contributions across the course of the past few months!
